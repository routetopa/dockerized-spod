##ODE

The ODE plug-in connects SPOD with the DatalEt-Ecosystem Provider (DEEP). In particular, it:
* Enables the integration of Datalets into Oxwall
* Allows the user to create and modify Datalets (open data Visualization) through a wizard implemented by a “Controllet”
* Takes care of persisting user-created Datalets into the SPOD database.
ODE is a fairly large plugin that cover every aspect of the use of datalets into SPOD. We will examine ODE features in more detail in the next subsections.

## Integration with Oxwall

ODE adds a button (see Figure 10. The datalet button for new posts.Figure 10) near the post creation control, so that a user can create new posts attaching a datalet.
The same feature is available when the user replies with a comment.
